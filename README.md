# cat-a-logger
Draft of a project I might get around to do.

By putting a camera and something like a Nvidia Jetson next to where I give water to stray cats
- Recognize that a cat is drinking using AI.
- Store images of the cat.
- Run another AI to tag the cat's characteristics (race, color, whether it has a collar or not).
- Publish the result on a public online database (website + API?) that can be searched using those tags.

If the AI is good enough, send a warning (email) when a cat not matching the known ones is detected, as it is likely a lost cat. These potentially lost cats should be displayed quite visibly on the website. Allow users to register to get these alerts.
